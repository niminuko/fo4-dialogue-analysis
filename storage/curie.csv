Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"The airport used to be a nightmare for outbreak planning. Now, not so much.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,My pre-industrial outbreak models are far more pertinent with the demise of the airport.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The desire to infuse the blood stream with ethanol is truly perplexing.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,This factory has many sharp edges. Be careful.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Where all the doctors? The nurses? This is a hospital, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"And if anyone in the Commonwealth gets sick or injured, how will they get help here?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Who can I share medical knowledge with here? This is most unsatisfactory.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If I were the hospital administrator, I would fire the janitorial staff.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Perhaps we can find some medical records here. Or something worthwhile.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder what discoveries or breakthroughs were made here.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,One can almost sense the science here. Long ago.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Hello Messieurs Scientists, are you here?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,No one to talk of meaningful matters here. Is this not a laboratory?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Are the scientists hiding?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"And the subways are not working, as well? The mayor has something to answer for.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Do you think we'll make our train?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"With the subway out of commission, yet another delivery vector is offline. That's good, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Can you get one of the trains working? It would be interesting to get first-hand data of their acceleration.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Hello? Is anyone here? The subway is supposed to be a busy place, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Ah no, this belongs to the military. It is illegal to trespass here.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I hope the army does not shoot at us. Tell them we are here for science.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I expected some sort of general to yell at us by now.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You should talk with the Governor. The military here is quite primitive.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Such a shame. So many weapons of war.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Ah, what does this place commemorate?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,And where are the crowds? People here seem to have little interest in history.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder what this looked like before... everything.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,And this is where all the people worked.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Stress in the office can pose considerable long-term health complications. Perhaps not so much now.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Should we talk over a water cooler? Is this still done?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I imagine this place has seen more productive days.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Did we miss the office's hours?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"This is a park, yes? Make sure you have your rabies shots.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Look out for ticks. They can carry Lime disease and other maladies.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Do you feel the need to picnic?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The outdoor air used to be good for you. I'm still evaluating if it's good now.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,A good walk outdoors is an excellent way of maintaining one's vigor.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I have very few medical records of places like this. They farm rocks here, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Mining accidents, though rare, can be quite devastating for those involved. Take care when mining here.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder what was unearthed here.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,This used to be a place where all the people lived. It's much quieter than I expected.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"A few nuclear weapons, and look, no people here. What a shame.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Watch where you step. You could trip on the rubble and maybe hurt your ankle.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The population density is far less than I expected.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The housing prices here must be quite affordable.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"This must be the ""downtown."" How exciting.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I hope we are not mugged. This is common in urban environments.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I think the cars need some repair. Maybe check the engine?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,We must remember to cross at the crosswalk.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I have made it to the big city. I must record this.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Ah, so many parts. Let me know if you find something useful.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If I suffer from deterioration, many good replacements parts can be found here.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,This whole place is quite unsanitary.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I think this community has a lot of truants.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,And there aren't even teachers here to talk to?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Learning is one of the most important virtues.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,A child's formative years has a profound effect on many things in adulthood.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I do not mean to alarm you, but I think the children are missing.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I have little desire to sail the ocean. So if we could not, I would appreciate this.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I prefer to stay on land. It is more stable.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Should we wear our life vests?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If you feel seasick, might I recommend medication?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,And the water is all around us. Most unnatural.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,We are so high above the ground now.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,And to think people worked and lived at such heights. One little accident and a terrible fall.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Don't get too close to the edge. Acceleration trauma is most dangerous.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Taking atmospheric readings.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Someone should contact the landlord. I think this building is in need of repairs.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Oh, see if they have any scientific literature.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I could use some quality oil. The good stuff.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Perhaps he has word of scientists?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Is this the one who loves the little bottle caps?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Barter is such a curiously human quality.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I have had a long, long time to stare at tunnels. Perhaps we could leave?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,More tunnels. This is not what I was hoping for.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,It saddens me that tunnels have survived so very well when other things have fallen.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder where this tunnel goes.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I think I will take this time to review old data.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The power here appears to be off.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"These machines provide a service, yes? Why are they off?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Maybe the workers are striking?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder what they stored here?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I am thinking the rent here must be cheap now.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,So much refuse here. It is a health hazard.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Rusted metal everywhere. Don't cut yourself.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Ah, the beach. Are we on holiday?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder if the entire ocean is irradiated. Or is the water purer far from land?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Converting the ocean's waters to potable radiation-free water would greatly improve the life of all. I must study this.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I recommend against swimming here. The water is quite cold. And irradiated. And potentially full of enemies. So, bad idea.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Maybe I should get some swimming trunks?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"A vault. You do know I wanted to study the world, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I have seen more than my fill of vaults.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder what purpose this vault serves.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Perhaps there is some modicum of new knowledge to learn here.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The Brotherhood seems to have much knowledge they could share.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The Brotherhood's technology is superb. This must be studied.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,How can the Brotherhood expand their knowledge if they do not share their findings with fellow academics?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I wonder, can one such as myself join this Brotherhood of Steel?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"With their vertibirds, airship, and other accoutrements the Brotherhood is what I expected of the outside world.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder if insects were particularly susceptible to the environmental factors after the War. So many different species.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"The biomass of all the insects of this world, how does it compare to the surviving human population?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Though I am not an etymologist, these insects are a rich source of data.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,If only the insects were less voracious. It would make them easier to study.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Fear of insects was a common phobia Pre-War. I think this fear is far more reasonable now.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"These Children. They are very odd, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,So these Children of Atom worship radiation? Would not the sun be a more appropriate focus for their adorations?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I think these Children should seek psychiatric attention.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The Children's willing exposure to radiation makes them fascinating specimens.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Someone should tell the Children about the dangers of radiation, I think.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I find no records of these Deathclaws. They are new to this world, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"In this biosphere, I believe humans are not the apex predator. The Deathclaw, I believe he sits at the top.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I would prefer we avoid Deathclaws. If I am destroyed, there is no more science that can be done.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Are Deathclaws always violent? Perhaps play some music for them? Or poetry?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"We should maintain vital statistics of the people. For causes of death, I think Deathclaw related injuries must be high on that list.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Some ""ghouls"" are in possession of their mental faculties. Others are not. Why?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Should ghouls be considered a new species?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I wonder if my oaths apply to ghouls, as well?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If you find any scientific journal articles on ghouls, I would be much obliged.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I should give a ghoul a full physical. I am certain the data would be very interesting.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"These Gunners should be careful. Some of their actions, I think, are illegal.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I would stay clear of the Gunners. They seem a most surly bunch.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Gunners. Common mercenaries. Of little interest to science.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I do not like the Gunners. They have no thirst for science.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Why aren't these Gunners in prison?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,It stands to reason that aquatic animals would succumb to the ravages of radiation.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Are Mirelurk claws a great delicacy?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,So their carapace did not protect their ancestors from mutation.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"The aquatic ecosystem is worthy of study. The Mirelurks role in this, I am sure, is quite fascinating.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I hypothesize that the initial cause of many animal mutations was mankind's research. The Mirelurk, for example.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Was the ancestor of the mole rat a mole or a rat? Does anyone know?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Potentially mole rat meat may be quite nutritious. A healthy diet requires a great deal of protein, after all.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Mole rats exhibit pack behavior.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"These mole rats are little more than pests, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Mole rats are a curious species.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,These raiders are quite a problem.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The raiders have no respect for personal property.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Does anyone up here engage in civilized discourse?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I suppose raiders are technically still homo sapiens.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I feel no remorse for terminating raiders. They offend me.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Are there more robots left than man? Sometimes, it feels as such.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Are any other Ms. Nannies about? Before I was modified this was my original model, you know.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Robots have proven quite adaptable, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,And even the robots have the itchy trigger fingers. What bad manners.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I sometimes wish that RobCo made its robots a little less... deadly.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The curious case of the FEV virus. Does anyone know its origins?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I believe Super Mutants must be sterile. Otherwise, surely, they would be found in even greater numbers.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If the FEV virus mutates and becomes airborne, then all the surviving humans would be at risk.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If I found a peaceful Super Mutant, I have many questions about their condition. Their pain tolerances. Do they get illnesses. Longevity. So many questions.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,It is a shame these Super Mutants force us to dispatch them.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,What a technological marvel these synths are.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Madame Fowler posited the idea that robotic evolution could surpass that of their creators. The synths prove this quite neatly.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,To talk with the Institute would be a dream. So many marvels they have created.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Do synths have a psychology? Or are they merely sophisticated machines?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I dislike the idea of destroying such works of engineering and science.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I can see why humans always prattle so much about love. It is quite intoxicating.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"You must be very careful. The idea of you coming to harm. There, my heart is fluttering again.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"You know, you move in such a delightful manner. It is very... stimulating.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I must warn you, the thought of you being... close with anyone else causes very complicated emotions in me.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I find myself eager for the night.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,It has hard to contemplate science with you so close.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Love. Love. Love. What a wonderful word.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Do not get overfond of danger, my love, I wish to journey with you for many years to come.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I find myself... humming inside. I feel so very... Happy, this is the word!",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"What a contradiction a human is. To be lacking in so many capabilities, but being blessed with such a tapestry of emotions.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,It is good to travel with such an esteemed colleague.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"The world above, on the whole, is disappointing. But I must say, you most certainly are not.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Such a treasure friendship is. I hope all value it as much as I.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I am getting used to a life of adventure. It can be quite... exciting, yes?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Is there a word for friends that are very, very friendly? Maybe the best friend? I have decided, we are bestest friends.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"It is comforting to know you have my back. I have yours, have no doubt.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I notice that other people stare at me. Is there something wrong with my backside?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Together, you and me, I feel we could make a positive difference in the world.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I was programmed to respect the laws of the land. But now, I find myself quite irked with all this lawlessness. For shame, all you lawbreakers.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"No matter how extreme the odds, together I think we will overcome.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Sometimes I feel things so vividly. It's a wonder people don't explode.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I find myself forgetting small details I knew before. The mortality rate of Influenza C... was it 88%? Or 89%? So frustrating.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I notice that other people stare at me. Is there something wrong with my backside?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Who knew that the chemical composition of the atmosphere could smell so... very off. We should visit someplace that smells nice.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,So much to experience and feel. How can I fit it all in one lifetime?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I find myself running out of energy every single night, like clockwork. How can I be expected to do anything worthwhile in just 16 hours every day?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"This gift of life you've given me, I am so... thankful. I feel thanks. A mix of obligation and... appreciation.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I am taking notes, analyzing data, and yet I keep getting distracted. By all manner of inconsequential things. How do you humans get anything done?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I think this being human agrees with me quite well.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"All of these bodily functions. How do you keep track of them all? I am hungry, I am sleepy. The list goes on.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If I may of be of assistance, you have but to ask.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Are all humans as formidable as you? If so, I must change some of my theories.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Sometimes, this constant traveling grows tiresome.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I believe what is important to you differs greatly from the things I value.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Is everyone in the world above like... you?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Sometime, I wonder if it is better if we take separate paths.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You should endeavor to treat your fellow humans with greater care.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Do we not all owe some obligation to each other? It is enlightened self-interest to help others.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If everyone behaved such as you, all society would breakdown.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If you want to part company, I would not object.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I cannot stand much more of this.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Is there no kindness in you?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You make the world a darker place.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,All I want is to do my science and help. And instead...,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,This is not what I expected. At all.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Soon. Very soon.,,"Muttering to herself, angry (talking about breaking up with the player)",
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I should've stayed at home.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,This situation cannot be tolerated.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,So many violations of my ethical coding.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,We are so opposite.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The sun is setting. Make sure to stay warm.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Sunrise is imminent. It'll be easier to evade those who desire hostility, now.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Another day has begun.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Despite the changes below, the constellations still shine bright.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Visibility has been reduced. Perhaps you should do one of your sleeps?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder if there are any meteorologists about. I hope it does not rain.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"You should get an umbrella. You don't want to catch a cold, do you?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The influx of data is hard to process. Apologies if sometimes I make little sense. I will work on this.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I have so much data on the world before the atom bombs. I fear I may have to delete some of it to store my new observations.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,It is hard to determine whether the surface is more or less susceptible to outbreaks. But a preparation plan is never a bad idea.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,My systems are eager to absorb new data. I find this traveling agrees with me.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Humanity is so resilient, to cling to life despite all of this. It is the duty of us all to further that survival.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"We must find the men of science and institutes of learning. Surely, they are out there still.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder what has happened elsewhere? Is what has befallen the Commonwealth atypical. Less extreme. More?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Please, let me see and scan as many indigenous life forms as possible. It is, of course, for science.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Humanity has fallen so since the bombs.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wonder if the data I am collecting will serve any purpose.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,SharedInfo,,,How delightful.,,Pleased,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,SharedInfo,,,How peculiar.,,Huh,
