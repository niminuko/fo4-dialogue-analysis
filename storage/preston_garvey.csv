Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,That's a lot of pipes.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Nothing here but rust and scrap.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Damn raiders. Preying on the hard-working people of the Commonwealth is about as low as you can get.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I guess these raiders think it's easier to just take what you want than it is to work for it.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,What these raiders don't understand is that life's hard enough without people turning on each other.,,,
