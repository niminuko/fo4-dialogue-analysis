Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If there was anything of value here, I'm guessing it's long gone by now.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Beautiful out here. Always loved the great outdoors.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Growing up underground makes you appreciate places like this.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Knew a guy that holed up in a subway tunnel once. When I found him, there was nothing left but bones.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Nasty as hell down here. Let's make this quick.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Ferals are attracted to these tunnels like bloatflies to a flame.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The caves I grew up in were luxurious compared to this dump.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Think we can get a few caps for any of this junk?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The hell were they studying here anyway? Bah. What a huge waste of time.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I'm betting nothing good for the world ever came from this place.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Might be a few meds mixed in with all this science junk. I'll let you know.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Ugh. Smells pretty bad around here. Hope the chemicals aren't toxic.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Seen my share of wrecked hospitals in my travels, but this one's pretty trashed.",,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Not much to search through around here.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,This might be a decent place to take a rest.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Always useful to remember where these spots are.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Hmm. Wonder if it's safe to stop here for a bit?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Don't know... I'd rather hole up somewhere with a solid roof over my head.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Hmm. Not quite as cozy as Little Lamplight, but I could call it home.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I grew up living in a cave just like this. Can you believe it?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You'd be surprised how much a campfire can warm up a cold place like this.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Only thing I missed when I was living underground was the daylight.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Nothing yells comfort like sleeping on a rocky floor.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Ugh. Smells like rotting vegetables in here.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,We might be able to scrounge up a decent bottle or two while we're here.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Wonder how many bottles a day this brewery churned out.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Been drinking since I was six. Never looked back.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,This is a great place to look for loose caps.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Never been in a plane before. Highest I've ever gotten is taking a hit of Psycho.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Don't spend too long near that plane wreckage unless you want to start glowing from your insides.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I can't believe the control tower's still standing.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Institute synths carry some valuable tech. Don't leave anything behind.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,There's nothing dumber than an angry Super Mutant.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You want to stop a robot in its tracks? Yank out its fusion battery.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Heard there are Pre-War robots that are still running. Now that's impressive.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Salvage whatever you can from these things.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You know why robots are so dangerous? Because they won't give up until they're destroyed.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,There's no doubt about it. Raiders are the scum of the Commonwealth.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,It's a pleasure to kill these guys.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Don't bother reasoning with a Raider. A bullet between the eyes is all they understand.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Mole rats will burrow right up under you if they have the chance.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,That smell is horrible. I think I'm gonna puke.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Don't underestimate mole rats. Seen them strip the flesh from a man's bones in a matter of minutes.,,,
