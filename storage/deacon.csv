Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I hate those little blood suckers.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,More ferals. Great.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Some jackasses call ferals ""ghouls"". Like ghouls don't have enough problems.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Bet you crapped your pants the first time you saw a feral. I know I did.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Gunners are one step above raiders in my book.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Don't underestimate the Gunners.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Who's pulling the Gunners' strings? No one knows.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Gunners give mercs a bad name. And that's saying something.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Gunner's have had bounties on me. Well, me under different names and faces. I want to see how many slots I can fill on their most wanted list.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I would've paid 50 caps to be with you the first time you saw one of the crabs. Must've thought you'd walked into a B movie.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Mole rat. The other white meat.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,When I retire I want to be a mole rat farmer. That'd be the life.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I know those raider can seem like idiots, but you should see their handiwork. We've done some good clearing them out.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Thanks for all those wacky Old World robots, pal. Just, thanks.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You can make some decent caps salvaging robots.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,It takes a lot of clips to waste tin cans.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Boston had a thriving tech industry. Which means we get a double helping of robots.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You should see what Tinker Tom can do with a robot. It's pretty amazing.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I think of Super Mutants as toddlers on steroids.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The FEV Virus. Helping demolish walls and kill civvies since 2077.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Super Mutants hit like a mac truck.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Sometimes it's best to just sidestep the 'Muties. They don't have the best eyesight.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Head shots work best against Super Mutants. A lot a lot of head shots.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I understand why Glory hates wasting Gen 1s and 2s. A very fuzzy line.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"I'm alright if we have to take out the Gen 1s and 2s. Barely, but alright.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Tinker records every place we find the early gen synths. He says it'll reveal the Institute's ""Master Plan"". Yeah, right.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,More synths. Great.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"EMP works well against synths. Well, the early models.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,So let me get this straight. You used to propel big metal birds in the sky and fly in them for thousands of miles? You're braver than I thought.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Why did they make these airports so big? You could have a whole city in one of them.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Good salvage in airports.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,One day I'm going to find myself an unlooted brewery and go on one hell of a bender.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If you find any bottles, let me know. It's party time.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"When you're covered in Super Mutant blood, coming off the Jet DTs, and you're one step ahead of the Institute - it's Beantown Brown time!",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,If you got the Institute on your ass a nice cave can be your friend.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Nice and dark in here. I like it.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The one thing you can count on in a nice comfy cave is company. It's prime real estate.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I prefer cave fighting to a shoot out up top. Fewer attack vectors.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Practically every cave in the Commonwealth has been used by the Railroad at one point or another.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,A nice comfy campsite. You bring the marshmellows?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,How inviting.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Hey, I could be a synth. I could be the best damn synth that ever synthed.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The open road isn't as bad with a buddy.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You should've seen the Railroad before the Switchboard. We had triple the agents we have now. We'll get there again.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"So, obviously I'm not going to risk my life for a... radio. But a Gen 1? Or Gen 2? Where to draw the line, huh?",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I'm used to running my ops solo. But this isn't too bad.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"Please, you do the talking. If I pick anything up, I'll let you know afterwards.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,The Commonwealth can be the enemy just as much as the Institute. We've lost plenty of synths to hate mongers.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I never really much cared for the Minutemen. The idea sounds great. But you give small men big power and sometimes you'll pay for it.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Keep your eye out for Rail Signs. Besides the goodie bags tourists and agents have left valuable intel.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"A lot of our people help us once, maybe twice a month. If that. You've jumped right into the deep end.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,This partnering up. It's weird. Sometimes I just want to pop a Stealth Boy and bug out. Not really an option now.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I wish Dez would green light the occasional mission to help out humans. Sometimes just a little bit of help goes a long way.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"You know, sometimes you really get on my nerves.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Maybe you should take someone else out next time. I think Glory would like traveling with you.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Some of these missions would be a lot easier by myself.,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"You know, if you helped people more you'd be a potent force for good out there.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You Pre-War types really did a number on the place. Hats off.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Ever wish you just hit the snooze button instead of thawing out to this?,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,There's too few good men left. The Commonwealth just chews them up and spits them out.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.,,Mumbling to himself,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Did I ever tell you about the time I was in Capital Wasteland? Now there's a tale.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I'm thinking next time I go to town I'll dress up as a Mr. Handy. If I pull that off I'll be a legend.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"If we take out the Institute someday, I wonder what we'd do. Hell, synths got it bad enough even without them. It'd keep us busy.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I'm in the mood for... some Blamco Mac n' Cheese. Or maybe mirelurk steaks with salsa. Mmmm.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"The Brotherhood. In Capital Wasteland, they really weren't bad. But now.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I really want to know how the Big One started. What idiot fired first? Why? What the hell did they think they'd gain?,,,

Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,You getting the hang of the Railroad yet? We're one big dysfunctional family. With guns.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,Sometimes it's hard to take Dez seriously. I remember her when she was a green recruit.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,I'm a sucker for those Old World books. It must've been something living back then.,,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,"One time, I got a face change and was a girl for a few months. You should've seen the looks back at HQ.",,,
Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous,Idle,,,One day the Railroad's number will be up. I thought that day had come at the Switchboard. I can't shake the feeling we're living on borrowed time.,,,
